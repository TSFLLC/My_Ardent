🧩 1. Technical Demo Script (2 Minutes) — Presenter Notes

Slide 1: Title — “CDE & RLS Proof of Concept – Strengthening Data Governance”

“Good afternoon everyone.
This month, our focus was on documenting and demonstrating two key components of our data governance strategy — Critical Data Elements and Row-Level Security.
Both are foundational for ensuring compliance, data protection, and structured access control across our SQL environment.”

Slide 2: Critical Data Elements (CDE)

“We started by identifying and documenting Critical Data Elements across core systems such as Employee, Provider, and EmpStatus.
Each field was analyzed and classified based on sensitivity — for example, Direct PII like SSN and Name, Quasi PII like Department or Title, and Operational Identifiers like ProviderID.
We also outlined how these elements should be handled across layers once implemented:

Bronze (raw) – restricted access

Silver (standardized) – normalization and masking/tokenization

Gold (analytics) – aggregated or de-identified data
This documentation establishes our reference for future implementation and aligns with HIPAA and internal governance standards.”

Slide 3: Row-Level Security (RLS)

“We built and demonstrated a proof of concept for Row-Level Security.
The POC includes a User_Department_Mapping table and a predicate function using SESSION_CONTEXT() to enforce department-based filtering.
During the demo, we showed how HR users see only HR data while Finance users see only Finance records — all from the same table.
This validated our approach for least-privilege access and will guide production implementation.”

Slide 4: Wrap-Up

“To summarize — we’ve completed documentation and a successful proof of concept for both CDE and RLS.
CDE defines what must be protected, and RLS defines who can see it.
This lays the groundwork for a secure, scalable, and compliant data-governance framework as we move toward production implementation.”
