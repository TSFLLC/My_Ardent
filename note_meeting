RLS & Data Protection Demo (2-Minute Presenter Script)
🔹 Introduction (0:00 – 0:20)

“Good afternoon everyone.
This month, we focused on demonstrating how Row-Level Security and Data Protection Techniques can strengthen our overall data-governance framework.
Our goal was to document, build, and test a proof of concept that shows how we can protect sensitive data while maintaining usability and compliance.”

🔹 Row-Level Security (RLS) (0:20 – 1:10)

“RLS controls who can see what data directly at the SQL Server level.
It ensures privacy — users only see rows that belong to their department or business unit — and it helps us meet compliance and audit requirements without adding complexity in the application layer.

In our proof of concept, we used a centralized mapping table that links users to their departments, and a security predicate function that filters records automatically based on session context.
This means HR users only see HR data, Finance sees Finance data, and so on.
It provides centralized, consistent, and auditable access control across all reporting and analytics tools.”

🔹 Data Protection Techniques (1:10 – 1:50)

“We also evaluated four key data-protection techniques:

Dynamic Masking: hides data on-the-fly at query time — great for production where we want to restrict what users see without altering the underlying data.

Static Masking: permanently masks data in a copy — ideal for development or testing environments.

Tokenization: replaces sensitive identifiers with secure tokens stored in a vault — used mainly for payment or ID systems.

Pseudonymization: replaces identifiers with fake but realistic values — very effective for analytics and GDPR use cases.”

🔹 Wrap-Up (1:50 – 2:00)

“Together, RLS and these data-protection techniques form a layered security model — controlling both who can access and how data is revealed.
Our proof of concept validated these methods as practical, scalable, and compliant solutions for future production rollout.”
