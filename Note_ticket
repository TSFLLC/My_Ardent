Created intro PowerPoint: Unified Data Access Governance Framework — Combining RBAC & Schema/Sensitivity Controls.

Built Excel v0.1 to catalog tables and sensitivity; presented materials to team and captured feedback.

In Progress

Deep-dive research on unifying RBAC + table-level GRANT/DENY and provider-based RLS (Epic).

Next

Expand deck (problem → target state → rollout plan).

Finalize Excel columns: System, Schema.Table, Owner, Sensitivity (PHI/PII/Internal), Proposed Role, Access Type (Read/Write), RLS Dimension (Provider/Dept), Notes.

Draft pilot scope + AD group → SQL role mapping.

Attachments

PPT (v0.1), Excel workbook (v0.1).

Dependencies

Sign-off on sensitivity tags; list of AD groups; Epic provider identifier standard (SER vs NPI).



Concise Jira comment

Completed

Defined Provider Critical Data Elements (CDEs) and documented in the Excel dashboard (attached).

For each element captured: definition, system of record (Epic/Clarity, NPPES, HR), data type, usage, owner, sensitivity (PII/PHI/Public/Internal), quality checks, and best protection choice with rationale.

Key CDEs covered: ProviderKey (enterprise), Epic SER, NPI, Name, Specialty/Taxonomy, Credentials, Status (Active), Effective/End Dates, Department/Facility, Location (business), License # & State, DEA #, TIN (if present), Contact (work email/phone), Affiliations, Billing/Rendering role.

Protections (summary):

Public: NPI, taxonomy → no masking; monitor integrity.

Internal sensitive: business email/phone, affiliations → RBAC / table-level GRANT.

Highly sensitive (if present): SSN, DEA#, personal address → tokenization/Always Encrypted; partial display in downstream views; audited access.

Added data quality rules (e.g., NPI 10-digit Luhn, active dates not in the future, license state in valid set).

Outcome

Single source list of provider CDEs with clear handling guidance for security and reporting.

Next

Confirm owners & stewards, finalize lineage, and get sign-off from Compliance/Clinical Ops.
