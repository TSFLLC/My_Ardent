Task Completed – KPI Dashboard in Power Apps

Accomplishments:

✅ Data Setup & Collections

Created collections for Periods, Pillars, Objectives, and KPIs.

Implemented filtering logic:

Filter(tblKPIs, PriorityID = varSelectedPriority.PriorityID)

Filter(tblPriorities, ObjectID = varSelectedObjective.ObjectID)

✅ Navigation & Screen Design

Built a single-screen experience to navigate from Pillars → Objectives → Priorities → KPIs.

Configured gallery controls with OnSelect actions for drill-down navigation.

Added DA Priority option as part of the priority set.

✅ Dashboard Functionality

Linked KPI display to the selected Objective/Priority for dynamic updates.

Validated end-to-end navigation flow (select Pillar → drill into Objectives → see Priorities → view KPIs).

✅ Data Source & Integration Prep

Used mock tables for testing during build.

Designed app structure to support migration to SQL Server backend.

Outlined approach for manager data contribution into SQL tables for ongoing population.

✅ Documentation & Knowledge Transfer

Prepared PowerPoint walkthrough to explain the concept, data flow, and dashboard hierarchy.

Delivered Excel/Word documentation showing table model, hierarchy, and relationships.

Ensured scalability for future multi-manager data input and SQL integration.
