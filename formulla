Summary:
Implemented the new one-page KPI dashboard with 3 filters (Department, Quarter, Year) and a 4-column layout (Pillar | Objectives | Priorities | KPIs). Data is served from SQL via an aggregated reporting view and rendered in a Power Apps Canvas app.

Whatâ€™s done

Created enterprise-neutral kpi schema and tables: Department, Pillar, Objective, Priority, KPI.

Built reporting view kpi.vKPI_OnePager (filters on DeptCode/Year/Quarter; aggregates text per Pillar).

Seeded sample data for 2025/Q3 across EDG, EDP, EDM, EAA.

Security: created powerapps_kpi_ro (read-only); GRANT SELECT on the view only, DENY base tables.

Power Apps: Canvas app with 3 dropdowns bound to SQL and a gallery bound to kpi_vKPI_OnePager (wrap + auto-height enabled).

Delivered a text-only Word guide and full SQL setup script.

Acceptance / Validation

Selecting Dept/Year/Quarter returns rows per Pillar.

Four columns display in the correct order with wrapped text.

App uses powerapps_kpi_ro; direct table reads blocked.

Next steps

Load final production data (including DisplayOrder) for each Dept/Quarter.

Confirm Department codes/labels and leader names.

(Optional) Add admin write path via stored procs + powerapps_kpi_rw and Power Automate flows.

If on-prem SQL, confirm On-prem Data Gateway connectivity.

Deliverables attached

SQL setup script (schema/tables/view/seed data/RO login).
