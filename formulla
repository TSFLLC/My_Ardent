Summary:

PII Direct → Identifies a person by itself.

PII Quasi → Identifies a person only when combined with other data.

OII Temporal → Time-based identifiers that, when linked with PII, can reveal someone’s identity.


✅ In Practice

Surrogate replacement is stronger and used when identity must be hidden but the structure should remain valid (good for testing/migration).

Initial replacement is lighter, usually for display masking (dashboards, reports) where some hint of the data is still useful.

⚖️ Example in Healthcare (HIPAA)

Patient full name (John Doe) → Surrogate: Patient-00123

Patient full name (John Doe) → Initial: J.D.

“At the Gold layer, we apply extra rules for privacy and business use. For supervisors, this means we don’t always show the exact name. Instead, we either roll it up to a department 
view (aggregate) or hide/replace the name with an ID or initials (mask). This way, leadership gets the insights they need without exposing personal identifiers unnecessarily.”
